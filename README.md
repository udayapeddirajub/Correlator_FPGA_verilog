# Correlator_FPGA_verilog
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of the Correlator Data Path and Controller for processing two 32-bit, 8-sample sequences with a positive lag model. The Correlator Data Path and Controller is a powerful hardware module designed to perform correlation calculations on two sequences of data. By leveraging Verilog, a hardware description language, we have implemented the necessary logic to efficiently process the data and generate accurate correlation results. The repository includes the Verilog source files, test benches for verification, and documentation explaining the architecture and usage of the module. To get started, download the repository and review the documentation. You can modify the design to suit your requirements or integrate it into your larger system. Use the provided test benches to simulate and validate the functionality, and then integrate the module into your project.
